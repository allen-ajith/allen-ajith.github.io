The sheer volume of courses and textbooks about Machine learning might seem overwhelming, but getting started is easier than you think. I first became interested during my second year of undergrad, which I spent in lockdown building ML projects. Here are some resources that I've personally used and found incredibly helpful.


0. [3Blue1Brown's Linear Algebra series ](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra)
-*Optional*, but a personal favorite cause it's a really intuitive introduction to matrix math we'll be using.

1. [Machine learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) 
- Beginner friendly introduction to Machine Learning that'll help you build a solid base.

2. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python](https://www.statlearning.com/)
- I used this more as a reference textbook and imo it's best to have a decent understanding of statistics and linear algebra before you start reading.  

### What next?

 I liked Deep Learning so I pretty much switched gears and learnt more about Neural Networks. My personal favourites are:

1. [3Blue1Brown's Neural Networks series ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
- Explains the math about backpropagation and gradient descent visually which is super intuitive.

2. [PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning by Daniel Bourke](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=LsCi0Tf8ktMzfxTx) 
- _When in doubt, code it out!_

3. [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)
- Combines theory, practical and also details mathematical implementations.
