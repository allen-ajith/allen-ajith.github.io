I'm a MSCS student at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html).

I did my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at School of Engineering, [CUSAT](https://www.cusat.ac.in/).

My current research interests are **reinforcement learning** and **model interpretability**. Previously, Iâ€™ve worked on projects related to representation learning, federated learning for privacy-preserving AI, link prediction and node sampling in social networks, and blockchain systems using zero-knowledge proofs.


Here is my *(hopefully updated)* [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf) <br>


<!--
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
